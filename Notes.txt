1.Awareness among people how easy building ML aglorithm is 

2.Ready to run python scripts ----> user run the code in their systems without any issues

3.Environment --> a place where a code is executed without any errors

Andriod apps ---> does not work in IOS
IOS apps -------> does not work in Andriod

Code -----------> Windows,Ubuntu,Linux,Mac

Github --------->


Company --------> Project ---> Team / Employee 

Research on what has to be done
Approach1 : write everything from scratch (Ample amout of time)
Approach2 : Using existing code he/she will to modify it according to the problem statement user is working on
# already exsiting codes

# Gitrepostories
# 3 or 4

# datagenerate.py -----> python datagenerate.py --num_samples <desired_num_samples>
# train.py ------------> python train.py --data_path <path_to_the_data>
# test.py -------------> python test.py (code to ask the user input) ---> right swipe or not



creating environment :conda create -n ml python=3.12.11
